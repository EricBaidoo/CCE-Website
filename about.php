                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Cross-Cutting Excellence (CCE) is a network of Christian Professionals endeavouring to transform their secular space with the wisdom of God; and we are serious about this. Our mission is to build the capability of Christian Professionals through Seculo-Spiritual Aptitude (SSA).</p>
                
                <p>Excellence is to excel, to have excess competence, be abundantly fruitful, to have more than may be immediately required...relevant more. Excellence is to possess eternal life.</p>
                
                <p>Christians are made to be excellent across-board: perfect unto every good work. The capacity of Christians is more than is needed for themselves; we have capacity to transform our lives, help transform others, catalyse the transformation of a whole global generation, generations; we have capacity even to judge angels; we are children of God; Co-heirs with Christ. These are not mere accolades; they are the word of God that does not return unto him void until it has accomplished its purpose.</p>

            <h2>The CCE Charter</h2>
            <h3 style="font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 600; color: #ff8800; margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0;">Promoting godliness in the secular space</h3>
            
            <ol style="line-height: 1.9; color: #495057;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Freedom and Responsibility:</strong> Freedom is a gift from God and includes a consequential sense of responsibility. When we choose freedom we make a decision of eternal value, and demonstrate that humanity is indeed created in the image of God.</li>
                
                <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Godliness Produces Excellence:</strong> Godliness is the mechanism by which freedom produces excellence; it is the expression of the character of God in a manner that excels and produces relevant more, abundant life.</li>
                
                <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Seculo-Spiritual Aptitude (SSA):</strong> God's word, encapsulated in the Bible and inspired by the Spirit of Christ Jesus, is the guidance by which the skill of godliness is manifested in secular endeavours. We refer to this concept as Seculo-Spiritual Aptitude (SSA).</li>
                
                <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Understanding Secularism:</strong> Secularism is ideally neutral and practically atheistic or godly. Thus, secular humanism is either godly or atheistic. It is delusional to perceive secularism as automated or independent humanity.</li>
                
                <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Godly Wisdom:</strong> Godly wisdom is the sapience and skill to perceive truth and enjoy the eternal pleasure of manifesting it in one's secular endeavours.</li>
                
                <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Truth is a Person:</strong> Truth is not a mere philosophy, ideology, intelligent reasoning: Truth is a Person.</li>
                
                <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Our Eight Faculty Endeavours:</strong> At CCE-Network we pleasurably work through eight Faculty Endeavours (FEs) to express the truth of the Lord Jesus Christ in secular engagements that promote the well-being of humanity, in pursuit of the glory of God.</li>
                
                <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>No Room for Self-Conceit:</strong> In the CCE-Network there is no room for self conceit, selfishness and corruption. We are admonished to eschew unhealthy political, religious, racial, sexual and national attitudes that undermine the love, light and holiness of God.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 500; color: #252163; font-style: italic;">We see Christians establishing the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ across the world through their secular professions.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 500; color: #252163; font-style: italic;">Building the capacity of Christian professionals to transform their various spheres of endeavour with the manifold wisdom of God.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-card">
            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>Between 2010 and 2012, a schematic summary of a Christian life purpose plan was discussed with several young Christian friends. It included a mission to glorify the Lord through transforming our generations by the power of Christ. Continued conversations and ordinary but spiritual fellowships galvanised the vision into concrete actions of prayer, sharing and planning for a conference of young people called The Salvage Group (TSG).</p>
            
            <p>In 2013, TSG organised the first pre-CCE conference under the theme "Purity and Prosperity". The outcome was the mobilisation of a promising group of ordinary Christians, including professionals and students, excited to be part of a vision to transform our generations to the glory of God. This mobilisation continued through annual conferences on various themes (e.g. Surge; Focus Diligence Consistency, Cross-Cutting Excellence; Invading the Secular Space etc), and post-conference activities to directly engage challenges and solutions towards realising the purpose of TSG.</p>
            
            <p>In 2017 CCE was formed, with a clear vision and strategy. CCE operates through 8 Faculty Endeavours (FEs), applying the Christian principles of Seculo-Spiritual Aptitude (SSA) to manifest godliness in excellence. The 8 CCE_FEs are Governance and Development (GAD), Education and Training (EAT), Science and Technology (SAT), Philosophy and the Arts (PAA), Finance and Business (FAB), Relationships and Family (RAF), Missions and Apologetics (MAA), Communications and Media (CAM).</p>
