                        <p><strong>The Holy Ghost is more than our inspiration</strong></p>
                        <p>We study the Bible to learn the Christian philosophy and the character of God. In an intentional manner we get wisdom in preparation for the work at hand.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>We learn to appreciate the goodness of God</strong></p>
                        <p>And through regular worship of God we are sensitive to the prompting of the Holy Spirit. We are in the presence of God.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Through obedience to the teaching of the scripture and the prompting of the Spirit of God</strong></p>
                        <p>Our lives are ordered, we are led, we are guided; we are inspired beyond being motivated.</p>

                        <p><strong>Preparation is Key</strong></p>
                        <p>Preparation to engage excellently with the assignment of God along our chosen secular path is the manifestation of that inspiration; and it is done intentionally.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Integrity and Quality</strong></p>
                        <p>Thus, we make a deliberate choice not to cheat, cut corners, waste time, or pretend to work. We apply our very best effort to produce our most impeccable output.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Commitment to God's Standard</strong></p>
                        <p>Our preparation and performance is intentionally according to the standard of God, by the instruction of the Holy Spirit.</p>

                        <p><strong>Focus on the Eternal</strong></p>
                        <p>Being an excellent Christian professional includes being intensely focused on the eternal. We are engaged in eternal projects. We are invested in eternal causes. We act in the confidence of eternal rewards.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Diligence in Action</strong></p>
                        <p>The intensity of our engagement is reflected in our diligence. We do the most essential things per time. We are seldom distracted. We are very effective and efficient.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Consistency Over Time</strong></p>
